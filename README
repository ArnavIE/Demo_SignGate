Project Name:
SignBridge ‚Äì Bridging the Communication Gap with Hand Signs

Project Abstract

SignBridge is a simple real-time hand gesture recognition system that helps non-sign-language users communicate easily with deaf and mute individuals. It uses a webcam to detect basic hand signs and displays the meaning on the screen using text. The goal is to break communication barriers by providing an easy-to-use, real-time tool ‚Äî with no prior sign language knowledge required.

Dataset Used

No dataset used in this version.
Gestures are recognized using **rule-based logic** on hand landmarks (no machine learning).
(Future Plan): Use gesture image dataset to train a model with TensorFlow.

How It Works

1. The webcam opens and captures your hand.
2. **MediaPipe** detects hand landmarks (21 key points).
3. **OpenCV** displays the live video and overlays detected gesture text.
4. Simple logic (no ML) checks if fingers are open/closed.
5. Displays the corresponding gesture meaning (e.g., ‚ÄúHello üëã‚Äù).
